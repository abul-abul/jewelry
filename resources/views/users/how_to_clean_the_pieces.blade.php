		<p>Our jewellery is produced in a handcrafted manner with various materials that require a particular type of cleaning. Below you will find some tips to follow depending on the type of piece:</p>

<p><b>SILVER PLATED PIECES:</b></p>
<p>Sterling silver can darken when exposed to the air and light, or in certain cases, by the different types of Ph of the skin. To clean these types of pieces we recommend that this is done by using a soft cloth or with a non-abrasive silver cleaner to prevent damage.</p> 

<p><b>GOLD PLATED PIECES:</b></p>
<p> For the proper cleaning of these pieces, we recommend you use a soft cotton cloth on a regular basis (weekly) to keep the jewel in good condition. In the event that the piece is very dirty the same cloth can be used with warm water and mild soap, and once the process is finished, dry with a soft dry cloth or paper. Care must be taken with the stones or crystals that the piece may have, because these materials may require another type of care.</p>

<p><b>HOW TO STORE Your Valuable Purchase</b></p>
<p>To maintain your Oh Scarlett Jewelry as new, we recommend it is stored in an individual bag, in its original packaging or in a closed box. Try to prevent contact with the air, direct light or humidity, as this can lead to deterioration of the piece. 
Keep in mind that jewellery is greatly affected by external Ph so it is important to avoid, as far as possible, any contact with perfumes or other cosmetic products.<p>
